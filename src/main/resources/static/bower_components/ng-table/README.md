## Using Typescript?

As of v2.0.0 ngTable is written in typescript and so you do NOT have to install external type declarations for this library.

By installing the [ng-table package from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-table), you will get typescript intellisense for all ng-table exported types.

**WARNING:**. The type definitions on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/ng-table) are depreciated.


## Upgrading from an earlier version?

### Upgrade from 0.8.3

It's recommended to upgrade in two jumps:

1. Upgrade to version 1.0.0-beta.9, making any changes to your application code neccessary to work with this version
    * EG: `bower install ng-table#1.0.0-beta.9 --save`
2. Refactor your application to remove any code that depended on depreciated behaviours that where removed in the 1.0.0 release
3. Install 1.0.0 (should now be a drop in replacement for 1.0.0-beta.9)
    * Bower: `bower install ng-table#1.0.0 --save`
    * NPM: `npm i ng-table@1.0.0 --save`


### Upgrade from version earlier than 0.8.3

It's recommended to upgrade in three jumps:

1. Upgrade to version 0.8.3, making any changes to your application code neccessary to work with this version
    * EG: `bower install ng-table#0.8.3 --save`
3. Follow the guide above to upgrade from 0.8.3 -> 1.0.0-beta.9 -> 1.0.0
